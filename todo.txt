# To-Do

- Build meta-verbs (add_source, add_description, add_annotation, add_changes)
- Build S3 methods for metaframes (summary, print, str, write.csv)
- Build source, description, annotation, and revisions objects, give them 
some proper format and structure, and checkers/addition/subtraction operators


# Misc

- current common functions that add attributes to data.frame(like objects)
  that we should avoid over writing and/or can look to for inspiration:
  
  - `stats::reshape`
  - `dplyr`
  - `data.table`
  - `foreign` and `haven` 
      - str(foreign::read.dta("http://www.stata-press.com/data/r12/lifeexp.dta"))
      - str(haven::read_dta("http://www.stata-press.com/data/r13/lifeexp.dta"))
        - and check out View(haven::read_dta("http://www.stata-press.com/data/r13/lifeexp.dta"))
        - and haven::labelled()
      
- Also could create functions to access variable labels for 
  plotting or making tables
